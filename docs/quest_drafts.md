# Quest drafts

These are the quest writer's drafts. None of them is canon until Michael promotes it into `quest_writing.md`, and none is a spec until it is approved. Each draft gives the quest's shape, every line verbatim with its speaker and people, and a note on what in the code would carry it.

## The Seventh Niche — the Guest lorebook, the defaced niches, the Church's line

*Unapproved. Drafted 28 Sep 2026. Backlog A, Lore objects: the Guest lorebook, defaced niches, and the Church's line on the Guest. (The sigil-lore books are the other half of that line and are left for another run.)*

### What the canon fixes

Canon §4.2 says the seventh god, **An tAoi, the Guest**, has no shrine. It is found in defaced niches, in a chapel the Church bricked up in Aurenne's capital (**Cill an Aoi**, already built: the cellar under the capital's cathedral, *Press 'E' to pray*, black for four seconds, *It saw you.*), and in a lorebook that argues whether the Guest is a god or an *intrusion*. The Church says the Guest is a mistake of the old culture. Varek's heresy is that the Guest is real and has arrived. The three descriptions (*the one who returns; the one who walks the shortest road; the one who dies and does not*) recur in old art and older songs. They are not a prophecy, and no one applies them to the player until Act III, once.

This draft doesn't add a quest-log quest. It lays a trail of three things the player can find in any order, ending with a direction to the chapel, which canon says is findable and which nothing in the build points to today:

1. **The niche.** A struck-empty niche beside the altar of every shrine. The player can examine it. It is the first time the player learns that something was taken out.
2. **The book.** *The Seventh Niche*, a Church disputation. It lays out the case for *god* and the case for *intrusion*, gives the Church's answer, and quotes the three descriptions without applying them to anyone. A lore book, not a skill book.
3. **The priest.** Once the book is read, or the chapel is found, any priest will answer *"Who is the Guest?"* in the priest's own people's voice. Each answer ends by naming the city whose cathedral hides the chapel.

**Changes.** Nothing in the world state except what the build already keeps. It gives the chapel a road to it. Once the player has prayed there, the priests' answers change.

**Reward.** None. The chapel gives no boon, and the trail to it gives none either.

### 1. The niche

**Prompt** (near the niche, at every shrine):
> Press 'E' to look at the empty niche

**Examine** (a popup in the register of the Mouth and the keystones: second person, what you see first, then what it means):
> Beside the altar, set low in the stone, is a niche the size of a hand. It has been emptied with a chisel. Not worn away by weather: struck, and the marks are as old as the carving around them.
>
> The offering ledge under the altar is worn smooth by hands. The ledge under the niche is not. Whoever emptied it made sure nobody would bring it anything again.

### 2. The book — *The Seventh Niche*

The prose is in the Aurennais institutional register: formal, qualified, contracts and terms, and never an oath. The margin note on the last page is in a Gatelander's hand and voice. The author is unnamed, as in every book the game has.

**Item name:** The Seventh Niche  **Icon:** 📜 (or the lore-book icon if one exists)  **Description line in the bag:** `Lore book` / `Lore book (already read)`

**Pages:**

> THE SEVENTH NICHE
>
> A disputation, in the form the Church's schools require: the question, the case for, the case against, and the answer. Copied for the library of the Prior. The clerk who set it down did not sign it.

> THE QUESTION
>
> Whether the Guest, whom the old people named An tAoi and for whom they cut a niche but no figure, was a god of theirs, or something that came in among them and that they mistook for one.
>
> The Church has answered, and the answer is on record: the Guest is a mistake of the old culture, a word for weather or for grief that the carvers made into a figure, because they made a figure of everything. This disputation does not reopen that answer. It sets down the case against it, as the schools require, so that the answer can be seen to have been earned.

> THE CASE THAT IT WAS A GOD
>
> It is argued, first, that at the oldest shrines the six have a figure and a tool each (the hull, the sundial, the wolf, the gate, the lamp, the shuttle) and the seventh has a niche. A people who made a figure of the weather would not leave a niche empty by mistake at every shrine they built.
>
> It is argued, second, from the Weaver's own work. A loom is not strung for the weaver. It is strung for whoever is to wear the cloth. If the loom was strung, it was strung for someone, and the old people had a name for that someone.

> THE CASE THAT IT WAS AN INTRUSION
>
> It is argued against, first, that no offering has ever been found in a seventh niche: no coin, no bone, no ribbon. The old people paid all six. What sat in the seventh was not paid. It was watched.
>
> It is argued against, second, that the niches were not left empty. They were emptied. The chisel marks are as old as the carving, so the people who cut the niche are the people who struck it out. One does not strike out one's god. One strikes out a door that was opened, and should not have been.

> THE SONGS
>
> Three phrases recur in the old carvings and in the older songs. The clerk sets them down as the library has them: *the one who returns; the one who walks the shortest road; the one who dies and does not.*
>
> The Church reads them as the old people's names for the dead. The clerk observes that the dead do not return, do not walk, and do die. The Church's reading is the kinder one. It is not the more exact one.
>
> They are not a prophecy. The old people did not prophesy; they described. Whatever these describe, they describe as something already seen.

> THE ANSWER
>
> The answer stands as the Church gave it. The Guest was a mistake of the old culture.
>
> The clerk records one reservation, as the schools permit. The Church holds the Guest to be a mistake, and has seen fit to brick up the one chapel where the mistake was ever given a figure, and that figure was given no face. The clerk does not dispute the answer. The clerk notes only that it has been paid for twice.
>
> *In the margin, in a different ink and a plainer hand:* A door you brick up is still a door.
>
> *And below it, smaller:* Weaver keep whoever reads this after me.

### 3. The priest — *"Who is the Guest?"*

The topic appears at any church once `booksRead.has('seventh_niche')` or the chapel has been visited. `${cap}` is the name of the capital, `guestChapelHouse().name`. There are two states: **before the chapel** (the book has been read, the chapel not yet found) and **after the chapel** (`vstate().chapel`).

**Aurennais priest** (the Church's own line):
- *"Who is the Guest?"* → "The Guest is a mistake of the old culture, Master: a word for weather, or for grief, which the carvers made into a figure because they made a figure of everything. That is the Church's position, and it is settled. I would not advise you to go looking for it unsettled."
  - Follow *"Then why brick up its chapel?"* → "Because a mistake given a statue is still a mistake, and a statue invites a certain kind of visitor. The chapel lies under the cathedral at ${cap}, closed by the Prior's order. I tell you where it is so that you are in no doubt about where you are not permitted to go."
- *After the chapel* → "You have been below. I can see it on you, Master. I will not ask what you found there. The Church has no clause for it."

**Gatelander priest:**
- *"Who is the Guest?"* → "The Church says it's a mistake the old people made, and the Church has more books than I have. But my grandmother set seven cups on the dresser and filled six, and she never once said the seventh was for nobody."
  - Follow *"Then who was it for?"* → "Ask a shut door who it's shut against and you'll get the same answer from it as from me. They bricked up its chapel under the cathedral at ${cap}. A thing you brick up is a thing you're not done with."
- *After the chapel* → "You went down. Well. What's seen can't be unseen, my mother used to say, and she said it about smaller things than that. Weaver keep you."

**Markish priest:**
- *"Who is the Guest?"* → "Church says it's a mistake. Old carvers' mistake. That's the word I'm given."
  - Follow *"And your own word?"* → "Same word. I'd not bet a knife on it. Chapel's under the cathedral at ${cap}, bricked up. I wouldn't go."
- *After the chapel* → "You went. Aye, I can see it. Don't tell me."

**Old Blood priest** (sparing, and the older word first):
- *"Who is the Guest?"* → "An tAoi. The guest. My mother set no cup for it, and would not say why."
  - Follow *"The Church says it was a mistake."* → "The Church says so. The Church bricked its chapel at ${cap}. We did not ask them to. We did not ask them not to."
- *After the chapel* → "You went below. Sit a while before you walk. The cold goes, mostly."

### What in the code would carry it

- **The book.** A new `BOOKS` entry, `{id:'seventh_niche', name:'The Seventh Niche', ico:'📜', attr:null, pages:[…]}`, with the six pages above as six strings. Each `\n\n` in a page is a paragraph break, as in the other books, and the italic margin lines are plain text. Four places read `def.attr` (grep `BOOKS.find(b=>b.id===it.bookId)`: the bag description, reading, and two more). Each needs a branch for `attr:null` that grants nothing and says `Lore book`. `randomBookItem()` should leave it out of the skill-book rolls. Placement: one copy on a shelf in every Mages' Guild (the guild libraries), and a rare roll in `library_chest`. No copy in the capital's cathedral: the player should arrive there already knowing.
- **The niche.** At every shrine (`site.kind==='shrine'`, built beside `S.altar`), a small dark recess in the altar's plinth or the stone behind it, and a prompt and popup on E within about 1.5u. It goes in the same loop as `shrinePrompt` / `shrineInteract`, checked before the altar so that the two prompts don't fight: the niche sits to the side of the altar, out of the altar's 2.6u ring. It has no state and gives nothing.
- **The priest.** Next to `penanceTopics(site)` in the church def's `_extraFn` (grep `the priest hears a confession`), add `guestTopics(site, def)`. It returns `[]` unless `booksRead.has('seventh_niche')||vstate().chapel`. It chooses the lines by the priest's people (`def.people||peopleOfSite(site)`) and the state by `vstate().chapel`. `${cap}` is `guestChapelHouse()?guestChapelHouse().name:'the capital'`. In the before state the follow is a folder topic with one follow; the after state is a single response.
- **worldState.** Nothing new. `booksRead` (saved) and `vstate().chapel` (saved) already exist.
- **The sixth discovery.** Unchanged. The chapel still sets `vstate().chapel`, and Varek still watches the player's hands the next time they meet.

### Checked against the canon

- *No chosen-one prophecy.* The book says outright that the three descriptions are not a prophecy, and nobody in the draft applies them to the player.
- *The Clearing is not revealed.* The book never says what the gates do to the dead. The Church still doesn't know.
- *The Withdrawal.* It is echoed and not stated: *"the people who cut the niche are the people who struck it out"* agrees with *"they broke their own order the same year"* without naming it.
- *Cill an Aoi.* The book's *"given no face"* agrees with the chapel's *"a statue with no face."*
- *Where the canon is silent:* whether the old shrines had a seventh niche. The canon says the Guest is *found in defaced niches* and has *no shrine*. I chose the plainer reading: a niche beside each god's altar, struck empty, and no shrine of its own.
- *Register.* The Aurennais lines use *Master*, terms, clauses and no oath. The Gatelander lines give a proverb, never a bare yes or no, and swear by the Weaver. The Markish lines are short, with *aye* and no honorific. The Old Blood lines are few and put *An tAoi* first.
